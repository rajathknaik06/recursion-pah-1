""" You are tasked with implementing a program to print the first N Tribonacci numbers using a recursion.



The Tribonacci sequence is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the three preceding terms. 



General Form of Tribonacci number: 

a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3)  with a(0) = a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1. 



The program should recursively calculate each Tribonacci number and print them in sequence.



Example: 

 

Input: 5

Output: 0 0 1 1 2  



Input: 10

Output: 0 0 1 1 2 4 7 13 24 44  

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer N, representing the number of Tribonacci numbers to print.

Output format :
The output should display the first N Tribonacci numbers, separated by a space."""

                printTribRec(n - 2) +
                printTribRec(n - 3))
